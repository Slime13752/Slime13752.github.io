		<h1>Wish Guardian (2021-2024)</h1>
		<p>In 2021, I joined the Wish Guardian team. We created Wish Guardian, a
			video game focused on blending farming and card combat mechanics.</p>

		<p>During my time on Wish Guardian, we won a spot in the RIT MAGIC Makers Program, where we were paired
			with Rockstar Games to learn some of their knowledge and expertise with video games. I was the one who
			made the Unity build that we submitted when we applied to be in the MAGIC Makers Program.
		</p>

		<p>I was the first artist on the Wish Guardian and I helped shape the art team. I was the head artist of our
			props,
			including the towers, crops, and many props. Most props were made by myself.
			In the next section you will be able to browse through my top 11 best assets.

					<h3 class="left">Pixel Art</h3>

					<ul class="left">
						<p>Summary:</p>
						<li>Learned how to make pixel art assets all on my own.</li>
						<li>Made art in a team with animation majors.</li>
						<li>Applied to the MAGIC Makers Program as a team.</li>
						<li>Learned how to shade my own pixel art assets.</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="left one">
						It was difficult for me to make pixel art at first. But through collaboration with my peers (who were animation majors), I learned to excel. Wish Guardian was my first experience in developing a game.
					</p>

					<p class="left one">
						I started on Wish Guardian as a freshman with little exposure to the art production pipeline. I taught myself GIMP to make pixel art assets. My first tower had a very limited color palette, mostly bright red and bright yellow. I was proud of it at first because it was functional as a tower and had limited animation. Eventually, my team of artists had grown and upon receiving feedback, I realized that my towers could use a lot of improvement. By the time our project was coming to a close, the feedback I was getting had radically changed. When I first showed off my amber tree, Steph, the sound designer, said “it looks like I could climb this tree.” The reason I remember that quote and am so proud of my amber tree in particular, is that it showcased my newfound ability to shade which led to my artwork looking realistic and having an illusion of depth even though the art was two dimensional. 
					</p>

					<p class="left one">
						I was the lead artist on Wish Guardian. Because of that, it was my job to manage and create all tower art. After I had made some of my first towers, we applied to the MAGIC Makers program which only accepts around 5 game development teams a year. We gained funding and technical support through employment in RIT’s MAGIC makers program. For a while, most of my art had a limited color palette. Adding shading to my sprites was a challenge, but also led to a great improvement in quality. One particularly memorable shaded piece I made was a dandelion that was a prop for the overworld. I got feedback from Jo that the coloring of the dandelion looked flat. I eventually realized that the best way to fix the coloring of a dandelion was to add transparency to the white parts of the dandelion, because in real life, dandelions are somewhat see-through. In pixel art, you have a very limited ability to add detail, so you have to be creative in how you express your detail just through changes in a couple of pixels.
					</p>

					<p class="left one">
						Initially, I went without shading because it was too advanced for me. With my Wish Guardian teammates and some helpful Youtube tutorials, I finally got my hands dirty with shading and my pixel art drastically improved. The animation majors on my team were particularly helpful with guiding me through the art pipeline and teaching me techniques. During my time on Wish Guardian, I have probably made over 200 shaded pixel art assets.

					<p class="left two">
						As I am a Game Design and Development major at RIT, it seemed only natural for me to try to do the job of a game designer for Wish Guardian, even though I had not yet taken a class that would teach me some of the aspects of game design. 
					</p>

					<p class="left two">
						As an artist on the team, I would create the sprites for various towers and cards. I wasn’t just consulted for the art of a tower or prop though. My team leader trusted me to make judgements about what a tower would do, such as deciding that the ice mushroom would have the power to freeze an enemy for a limited time. That is where game design comes in for Wish Guardian. I decided tower effects such as how the sand towers slow enemies down, the fire towers deal burn damage over time, and the poison towers deal poison damage over time. Not only that, but I have some experience with tower defense games like BTD5. I grabbed some ideas like tower boost abilities and brought them over to Wish Guardian. We designed 3 tower defense abilities: tower attack speed boost, tower damage boost, and player heal (because at the time, wraiths were eventually reaching the player and hurting them). These tower defense abilities were usable after defeating some wraiths which would give mana. Mana was how players had a budget for how much they could use a tower defense ability. Use all your abilities at once and then you have none left for later.
					</p>

					<p class="left two">
						As a team, we concluded that card deck builders would be more profitable. I did some of my own research into the individual components of various successful card deck builders. 
					</p>

					<p class="left two">
						We pivoted to card deck builders and I played an active role not only in researching successful card deck builders, but also in prototyping my own version of a card game deck builder. In my version of Wish Guardian, cards are sorted into a couple of different decks. There are farm decks, attack decks, and defense decks. You select to farm for a turn when you don’t have enough resources. Once you have more resources, you can craft cards while in combat and crafting cards doesn’t spend your turn. Once you are equipped for battle, you can select to attack or defend for a turn and you make this decision based off of the intent that the wraith is displaying. I also wanted to incorporate an action menu to incorporate some RPG elements directly into the card combat. This would be like in Undertale where you can choose to flirt with a frog and then spare it, dealing no damage but ending the fight peacefully. Unfortunately my vision for Wish Guardian was cut, mostly because people didn’t like using a turn just to farm. In the end version of Wish Guardian, you never use farming cards in combat. You can only use them outside of combat. You can take your time farming before starting combat, but once you start combat you get a hand of all the random cards in your deck. You may get 3 shields and 2 swords or 4 shields and 1 sword in your turn. You also can’t see the intent of the enemy wraith, so you never know what it will do during your turn. It may fight you or it may shield itself. I don’t mind Wish Guardian being this way, and I only included farming cards in my design because my team had already programmed some farming cards into the first card based combat prototype. In Inky, farming during combat was basically the only way to craft new cards. I think I designed a decent game for the Inky limitations. On top of designing a card based combat prototype, I also designed regular cards for card based combat. Some card examples would be the powerful phoenix spell, the fire wall, the ice ring, or the fire volley and the ice volley cards which I intended to be used as card combination spells. One of my proudest game design feedback for Wish Guardian is that I want cards in Wish Guardian to make card combinations. For example, you lay down a sand castle for the wraith and then you use fire volley on the wraith. The heat from the fire volley would also cause a new card to be made: the glass castle. This could additionally distract the wraith. I’ve come up with many such ideas for cards to create card combos. I made the art for these ideas, although a lot of them aren’t implemented. We did, however, implement the mechanics of card combos into Wish Guardian. As it currently stands, if you use 3 weak shields in a row you can get a card combo of a stronger shield.

					</p>

					<p class="left two">
						I expressed interest in designing minigames for Wish Guardian, especially after we had finished designing and implementing the basic combat. We already had a fishing minigame present in the game, so I was thinking adding more minigames could make Wish Guardian more interesting. Maybe someday there could even be a card crafting minigame or a cooking minigame. The mini game I made a paper prototype for was a sort of platformer/minecart ride game. I came up with a couple of different ways it could go. In one way, it is a normal platformer like Mario where you are on a minecart on a track but you can jump various gaps. Another prototype is having minecart tracks in a platformer style where you press a button to switch tracks and avoid obstacles. Conversely, another prototype has it where the action isn’t a 2D platformer but it is a 3D first person platformer that also has minecart tracks and you see the obstacles coming your way in the regular sort of format that Wish Guardian takes place in. I was thinking we already have magic and portals in Wish Guardian, so it wouldn’t be a stretch to have a portal to a 2D platformer world where you are no longer in the regular dimension of Wish Guardian. I had fun designing these prototypes for a minigame even though they never actually made it into the game.

					<p class="left three">
						As I was in the MAGIC Makers program under the team of Wish Guardian, each month we would meet with top Rockstar designers and developers through RIT, where I would take notes on all the feedback and criticism that they had for our game. After our Rockstar meetings, we would usually hold a team meeting where we would discuss my notes and what direction we wanted to take.
					</p>
					<p class="left three">
						During my time at MAGIC Makers, I would report to my supervisor Aaron along with other team members about what we have gotten done each week. I was the one in charge of submitting our progress with Wish Guardian to Aaron every week through a Unity build. I had to make the Unity builds myself and I had to write up all the current bugs and progress being made on the game with one of my teammates. It took a lot of accountability to make progress every week to have to show for Aaron. On top of these weekly meetings with Aaron, our own team would hold weekly meetings as well or at least have a weekly standup where everyone would state the progress they made in the past week for our team leader to see. Sometimes I even hosted my own team meetings, because I was the second in command for Wish Guardian.
					</p>
					<p class="left three">
						After my time in RIT’s MAGIC Makers program ended, our team’s next challenge was to transform Wish Guardian into a polished product using the skills and advice we received from MAGIC Makers and Rockstar. One of our first biggest changes was pivoting our combat system. Through research, we found out that card deck builders were more successful than tower defense games. Thus, we switched to a card combat system which took a couple of months to prototype and get right. I was one of the main people prototyping the new card combat system with Inky. During this transition, I was also researching many other successful card deck builder games through Youtube so that we could get ideas as to how to make Wish Guardian a card deck builder. We also invested heavily into innovating new game accessibility features. That investment paid off when we presented at Imagine RIT 2023. 
					</p>
					<p class="left three">
						Another major thing that the Wish Guardian team did after our time at MAGIC Makers was forming our own company, Wishstone Studios LLC. We had a very solid team, and our team leader handpicked the best and most reliable among us to be part of the company. I was one such person, my role being the prop leader. To form our company we met with lawyers, analyzed some contracts, and signed them. Eventually we had to actually close the company, not due to any legal issues, but simply because we were being charged over a thousand dollars in taxes and we didn’t even have any money flowing into the company because we weren’t ready yet to sell Wish Guardian.
