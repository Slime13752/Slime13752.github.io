		<h1>Wish Guardian (2021-2024)</h1>
		<p>In 2021, I met Carter Sargent. They gathered a team of designers and developers to create Wish Guardian, a
			video game focused on
			blending farming and card combat mechanics.</p>

		<p>During my time on Wish Guardian, we won a spot in the RIT MAGIC Makers Program, where we were paired
			with Rockstar Games to learn some of their knowledge and expertise with video games. I was the one who
			made the Unity build that we submitted when we applied to be in the MAGIC Makers Program.
		</p>

		<p>I was the first artist that Carter acquired for Wish Guardian and I ended up making many odds and ends art
			pieces,
			including the towers, crops, and many props. Later you will be able to browse through my best assets.
		</p>

					<h3 class="left">Getting Started</h3>

					<!-- Starting the team -->

					<p class="left">
						Although I had art experience throughout my schooling, Wish Guardian was my first video
						game. I taught myself GIMP to make pixel art assets, my main experience with pixel art being
						making
						pixel art through Minecraft creative mode.
					</p>
					<p class="left">As the initial artist on the team, I had to work in time to make Wish Guardian
						assets along with
						all the class time and homework I had while being an RIT student. To the left is my first asset
						that I made
						for Wish Guardian. I've improved leaps and bounds beyond this thanks to the feedback and advice
						given to me by
						other Wish Guardian team members who were animation majors.

					<h3 class="left">Honing My Skills</h3>

					<!-- Magic Makers Program -->

					<p class="left">
						After making some of my first towers, Wish Guardian applied to the MAGIC Makers Program.
						We gained funding and technical support through employment in RIT's MAGIC Makers Program.
						Every month, we met with top Rockstar designers and developers through RIT, and Wish Guardian
						slowly and steadily improved.
					</p>
					<p class="left">
						The biggest improvement to my art was adding shading to my sprites. Initally I went without
						shading because it was too advanced for me. With my Wish Guardian teammates and some
						helpful Youtube tutorials, I finally got my hands dirty with shading and my pixel art
						drastically improved. My first shaded asset was the star pond which is to the left/above here.

					<h3 class="left">Finishing Strong</h3>

					<!-- Imagine RIT -->

					<p class="left">
						After our time in RIT's MAGIC Makers program had ended, our next challenge was to transform Wish
						Guardian into a polished product using the skills and advice we recieved from MAGIC Makers and
						Rockstar. One of our first biggest changes was pivoting our combat system. Through research, 
						we found out that card deck builders were more successful than tower defense games. Thus we switched
						to a card combat system which took a couple months to prototype and get right. We also 
						invested heavily into innovating new game accessibility features. That investment paid off 
						when we presented at Imagine RIT in 2023. The Wish Guardian demo is currently available to play for free on itch.io!
