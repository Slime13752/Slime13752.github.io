			In 2021 I was a founding member of Wish Guardian, creating a video game focused on blending farming and card combat mechanics.

			After only one year of development, we won a spot in the RIT MAGIC Makers Program, cataloging our progress through my Unity build. As part of the MAGIC Makers Program, we received funding and were paired with Rockstar Games who shared their knowledge and expertise with video games to prepare us for publication and investment readiness.

			As the first artist on the Wish Guardian, I helped shape the art team. I was the head artist of our props, creating the majority of our props, including the towers, crops, and many others. In <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>, you will be able to browse through my top 11 assets. <a href="slideshow.html">Or, click this link to view a larger asset slideshow.</a>

			<i>Jacob always went above and beyond with any task given to him and adhered to strict deadlines. I could always count on Jacob during every part of the game development process: game design ideation, game asset creation, and game feature programming. Jacob even did outreach work at Imagine RIT, where he educated people on the accessibility features that our game possessed.
