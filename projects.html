					<p class="left one">
						As I am a Game Design and Development major at RIT, being a game designer for Wish Guardian was natural for me, even though I had not yet taken any game design classes. 
					</p>

					<p class="left one">
						As an artist on the team, I would create the sprites for various towers and cards. I wasn’t just consulted for the art of a tower or prop though. My team leader trusted me to make judgements about what a tower would do, such as deciding that the ice mushroom would have the power to freeze an enemy for a limited time. That is where game design comes in for Wish Guardian. I decided tower effects such as how the sand towers slow enemies down, the fire towers deal burn damage over time, and the poison towers deal poison damage over time. Not only that, but I have some experience with tower defense games like BTD5. I grabbed some ideas like tower boost abilities and brought them over to Wish Guardian. We designed 3 tower defense abilities: tower attack speed boost, tower damage boost, and player heal (because at the time, wraiths were eventually reaching the player and hurting them). These tower defense abilities were usable after defeating some wraiths which would give mana. Mana was how players had a budget for how much they could use a tower defense ability. Use all your abilities at once and then you have none left for later. 
					</p>

					<p class="left one">
						As a team, we concluded that card deck builders would be more profitable. I did some of my own research into the individual components of various successful card deck builders. When we pivoted to card deck builders, I played an active role not only in researching successful card deck builders, but also in prototyping my own version of a card game deck builder. Not everything I designed made it into the current game play but it all was an important part of the iterative process of determining its complex game systems including economy, combat, and progression mechanics. One of my proudest game design ideas was to use card combinations in Wish Guardian adding a strategic layer to gameplay where players must identify and assemble these combos to gain an advantage. For example, a card combination might look like this: you lay down a sand castle for the wraith and then you use a fire volley on the wraith. The heat from the fire volley would also cause a new card to be made: the glass castle. This could additionally distract the wraith. I’ve come up with many such ideas for cards to create card combos. I made the art for these ideas, although a lot of them aren’t implemented. We did, however, implement the mechanics of card combos into Wish Guardian. As it currently stands, if you use 3 weak shields in a row you can get a card combo of a stronger shield.
					</p>

					<p class="left one">
						After we finished designing and implementing the basic combat, I turned my focus to designing minigames for Wish Guardian. We already had a popular fishing minigame in the game and I believed additional minigames could make Wish Guardian more interesting. I developed a paper prototype for a platformer/minecart ride game. I pitched a variety of different game plays to the team. As a game designer, I knew not being tied to a single design concept allows for more objective evaluation of different options. In addition, comparing these multiple ideas, helped the team more easily identify which design elements work best and which need further refinement. But most importantly, I had a lot of fun designing these prototypes for a minigame!

					</ul>

					<button class="hide" id="dos">More Information</button>

					<p class="left two">
						During my time as a team lead, Wish Guardian was accepted to the MAGIC Makers Program. The MAGIC Makers Program is an RIT funded initiative that works to give student projects the support needed to succeed. Part of that support is monthly meetings with top Rockstar designers and developers. 
					</p>

					<p class="left two">
						When we met each month with top Rockstar designers and developers through RIT, I was the notetaker cataloging their feedback and criticism of our game. After our Rockstar meetings, we held team meetings to discuss my notes, our next steps based on that feedback, and what direction we wanted to take. On top of these weekly meetings, we also have internal weekly meetings or standups where everyone would share the progress they made in the past week for our team leader to see. Sometimes I even hosted my own team meetings, because I was the second in command for Wish Guardian.
					</p>

					<p class="left two">
						During my time at MAGIC Makers, I was in charge of submitting our progress with Wish Guardian to the MAGIC Makers manager every week through a Unity build. I created the Unity builds myself and with a teammate, wrote up all the current bugs and progress being made on the games. It took a lot of accountability to have progress to show every week. 
					</p>

					<p class="left two">
						After RIT’s MAGIC Makers program ended, our team’s next challenge was to transform Wish Guardian into a polished product using the skills and advice we received from MAGIC Makers and Rockstar. One of our first biggest changes was pivoting our combat system. Through research, we found out that card deck builders were more successful than tower defense games. Thus, we switched to a card combat system which took a couple of months to prototype and get right. I was one of the main people prototyping the new card combat system with Inky. During this transition, I was also researching many other successful card deck builder games through Youtube so that we could get ideas as to how to make Wish Guardian a card deck builder. We also invested heavily into innovating new game accessibility features. That investment paid off when we presented at Imagine RIT 2023. 
					</p>

					<p class="left two">
						After MAGIC Makers it was clear we needed to form our own company, Wishstone Studios LLC. We had a very solid team, and our team leader handpicked the best and most reliable among us to be part of the company. I was one such person, my role being the prop leader. To form our company we met with lawyers, drew up and signed contracts to make our LLC. Eventually we had to actually close the company, not due to any legal issues, but simply because we were being charged over a thousand dollars in taxes and we didn’t even have any money flowing into the company because we weren’t ready yet to sell Wish Guardian.

					<p class="left2 three white">
						In the summer of 2022, I was a programmer for a game called Tigers Tales. Tiger Tales is a geolocational augmented reality game. One of my main tasks was updating the geolocational interactivity points, implementing the specific vision of the game designer. Additionally, I also used existing documentation to implement 3D buildings into the AR feature allowing the user a more nuanced review of the game play. I also took an existing feature, the scrapbook, and added new functionality to it. Originally you could only change the page of the book one page/click at a time, but I implemented a function that would flip through the entire book, forwards and backwards, just to eventually find the right page that had the info the person requested. Essentially, the pages tracked data like building names, so my function would keep flipping through pages until the building name requested matched the building name of the page.

				<h3 class="left white">Pixel Art, Wish Guardian (2021-2023)</h3>

				<ul class="left white">
					<li>Part of game design ideation for game-play assets</li>
					<li>Taught myself GIMP</li>
					<li>Lead artist working within a team with animation majors to bring the game vision to life</li>
					<li>Produced art incorporating feedback from teammates and reviewers</li>

					<li>Learned how to shade my own assets</li>
				</ul>

				<button class="hide" id="quatro">More Information</button>

				<p class="left white four">
					It was difficult for me to make pixel art at first. But through collaboration with my peers, I learned to excel. Wish Guardian was my first experience in developing a game.
				</p>

				<p class="left white four">
					I started on Wish Guardian as a freshman with little exposure to the art production pipeline. I taught myself GIMP to make pixel art assets. My first tower had a very limited color palette, mostly bright red and bright yellow. I was proud of it at first because it was functional as a tower and had limited animation. Eventually, my team of artists grew and upon receiving feedback, I realized that my towers could use a lot of improvement. By the time our project was coming to a close, the feedback I was getting had radically changed. When I first showed off my amber tree, Steph, the Sound Designer, said “it looks like I could climb this tree.” The reason I remember that quote and am so proud of my amber tree in particular, is that it showcased my newfound ability to shade which led to my artwork looking realistic and having an illusion of depth even though the art was two dimensional. 
				</p>

				<p class="left white four">
					I was the lead artist on Wish Guardian. Because of that, it was my job to manage and create all tower art. After I had made some of my first towers, we applied to the MAGIC Makers program which only accepts around 5 game development teams a year. We gained funding and technical support through employment in RIT’s MAGIC makers program. For a while, most of my art had a limited color palette. Adding shading to my sprites was a challenge, but also led to a great improvement in quality. One particularly memorable shaded piece I made was a dandelion that was a prop for the overworld. After receiving feedback that the coloring of the dandelion looked flat, I realized that the best way to fix the coloring of a dandelion was to add transparency to the white parts of the dandelion, because in real life, dandelions are somewhat see-through. In pixel art, you have a very limited ability to add detail, so you have to be creative in how you express details.
				</p>

				<p class="left white four">
					Initially, I went without shading because it was too advanced for me. With my Wish Guardian teammates and some helpful Youtube tutorials, I finally got my hands dirty with shading and my pixel art drastically improved. The animation majors on my team were particularly helpful with guiding me through the art pipeline and teaching me techniques. During my time on Wish Guardian, I have made over 200 shaded pixel art assets.
