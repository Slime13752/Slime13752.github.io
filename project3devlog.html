		It took about 3 hours and some help from ChatGPT, but eventually I was able to get a prototype game working
		where
		there is a blue player circle that can move around a world. I was able to build up most of my framework myself
		where I created some tabbars like we learned to from a video and I created overlays just like demonstrated in
		class.
	</p>

	<p>
		I had to get a bit creative with how to handle players and cells in this world. Cells ended up getting a list of
		all
		entities and a list of all players, whereas players only needs a list of players. Players needs a list of
		players so that
		when a player dies, it can remove itself from the list of players and from the draw calls. Cells need a list of
		players
		to check their collisions against these players and handle all the death logic. Cells also need a list of
		entities to
		remove themselves from that list and from the draw calls.
	</p>

	<p>
		ChatGPT helped me out with giving me some sample code of how to change the color of a sprite. You essentially
		need to make
		a colorfilter and then turn that color filter into a paint and feed the paint into the sprite.
	</p>

	<p>
		ChatGPT helped me out again with giving me a collison detection method. It mostly works, but visually, the
		circles of the player
		and the circles of the cells are not the right size. At first, I tried to fix the cell size by altering the
		srcSize property of
		the sprites. This, however, made the cells appear smaller as they got bigger. The solution I found that works is
		altering the scale
		property of the player/cell instead.
	</p>

	<p>
		It took about 2 hours, but I finally got some random cell generation into the game. I had to mess around with
		adding a timer to the game,
		and for whatever reason, the game doesn't like me calling update within the game and within the cells. So, I
		pass the timer update function
		into the player and the player handles updating the timer and generating more cells. I made a condition that
		only the first player in the
		player list will update the timer. Hopefully, adding and removing players from the list will not mess with the
		timer logic.
	</p>

	<p>
		I spent about 2 hours trying to get the player score to update on the UI of the main overlay. I ended up going
		to class on 11/12/2024 to ask
		about this problem, and it turned out the solution to my problem was using a game provider which we had not yet
		covered in class!
	</p>

	<p>
		I had to pause development for a good while in November just to deal with other courses. However, on 11/27/2024,
		I finished the basic game loop.
		For a while, the player dying would just make them disappear. You wouldn't be informed that you died or be
		allowed to play again. Now, when
		the player dies, a gameover overlay will appear! You can press a button to try again, which will take you back
		to the title screen. After that,
		you can spawn again as a player with the start game button. It took a good amount of trial and error, but in the
		end what made my reset code
		work perfectly was simply repeating the code that spawns the starting player, and not executing the entire
		onLoad function. This took 30 minutes.
	</p>

	<p>
		After about 3 hours of work on 11/27/2024, I got the player to have a split button! This button mostly works as
		intended. When the player splits,
		it is like they have extra lives. The game is only over when all of their cells are dead. However, when the
		player splits, the new cells don't
		move at all. This could be useful but I wanted for the cells to launch themselves in the same direction the
		player is moving. How I aimed to
		achieve this "launch" was adding a speed multiplier to how fast the newly made cells move. However, I am not
		particularly noticing a faster
		speed for the cells. I am sure I can get this launch feature to work, it will just take tweaking.
	</p>
	<p>
		After about 2 hours of work on 11/29/2024, I got a leaderboard started. It took a while to figure out how to
		read and write an entire
		leaderboard into both shared preferences and just into a Tabbar as well. Currently, the leaderboard only works
		before the game starts.
		I think I will move the leaderboard into the game itself as another overlay.
	</p>
	<p>
		It took about 20 minutes to add the save mechanism into the game itself and now you can save your scores in the
		middle of the game,
		with the game even pausing! After about 30 more minutes of work, I have form validation working for the
		textfield that asks for username
		when determining what name to save the score with. For whatever reason, form validation prevents the save
		overlay from working.
		However, there is real and working form validation in the textbox below the game that works when the game is
		starting. I implemented another
		solution for form validation within the overlay_save.dart where it doesn't execute any code if the textfield is
		left blank.
	</p>
	<p>
		It took about 2 hours on 11/30/24, but eventually I got the player to be able to collide with other copies of
		itself! For a while,
		the player would essentially lose half of their size in order to create an identical copy and eventually both
		copies would be in the
		same place and it would be dead weight, the player loses those resources. However, I have now made it so that
		every 3 seconds, the players
		check for collisions with themselves and this doesn't prevent the player from spliting. It also encourages
		splitting, as now there is
		little downside to splitting. It can allow you to have extra lives, and in the case you find you don't need to
		split, you don't lose anything.
	</p>

		I've spent over 3 hours on audio (11/30/24). I was easily able to get audio to work for mobile by just following
		along with our class lecture videos.
		The problem is that audio doesn't work for chrome. I see no reason why it should be an issue. I've even tried 2
		different packages for audio
		(Flame Audio and just_audio). When I tried to implement either of those packages, audio wouldn't work anywhere.
		I think I will just have to stick
		with mobile development from now on. All of these packages say that their audio works on web.
	</p>
	<p>
		Update: On 12/2/24, the background music played once for me on chrome. When I had to restart the app, background
		music stopped playing. It hasn't
		played a single other time, but I think the issue is definitely a chrome issue. Update 2: actually, typing new
		code and hotreloading seems to
		fix audio?! That's a weird fix but I will take it. I just have to make changes in the code to hear audio on a
		laptop.
		Update 3: This audio fix no longer works after adding a splash screens and app icons. Hotreloading breaks
		sometimes.
	</p>

		On 12/2/24, I spent an hour trying to get the leaderboard to sort itself when it displays on the page. This
		endeavor failed. I tried creating
		a temporary list to hold all the scores. Then, I used a function from ChatGPT to convert scores back into their
		strings from the leaderboard.
		A for loop was going to iterate through the leaderboard and add the scores based on order of highest to lowest.
		This was stored in a temporary
		leaderboard, but as soon as I tried to replace the real leaderboard with the temporary leaderboard, things
		broke. I often times couldn't collect
		any cells to gain size as long as there was a name on the leaderboard. If you quickly load the leaderboard and
		then resume the game, you could
		play like normal, but even with all of that, the leaderboard was still in the wrong order!
	</p>
	<p>
		On 12/2/24, I have discovered that Tabbar is really not meant to work with a Flame Game. Every time you swap
		tabs, Flutter tries to create
		a new instance of your game. This can lead to errors on screen or a game that seems to work but is actually
		glitched!
	</p>
	<p>
		On 12/5/24, I solved the Tabbar problems mentioned earlier. It took about 3 hours of work. ChatGPT was somewhat
		helpful, some of my first
		prompts to it did not solve the issue. However, when I mentioned to chat GPT that my tabbars were disposing my
		gameProvider, ChatGPT
		suggested putting my gameProvider at a higher level in the code (main for instance) so that the gameProvider
		isn't destroyed when
		tabs switch. It works like a charm! The game music will only stop when the app is fully closed though.
